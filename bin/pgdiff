# This is a simple approach to track database schema changes in PostgreSQL.
# In some way it is similar to diff program, finding out structure changes
# and results in  SQL script to upgrade to new schema.
# 
# Differences are tracked on schemas, domains, sequences, views, tables, indices, constraints, rules, functions, triggers.
# Two objects with the same name are considered equal if they have the same definitions. 
#
# Missing features: tracking of ownership,  user rights, object dependencies, table inheritance, type casts, aggregates, operators.
#
# Usage:
# ./pg_diff source_connection_string destination_connection_string
#
# The format of the connection strings is documented in the Ruby pg gem
# at http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/pg/PG/Connection:initialize.
